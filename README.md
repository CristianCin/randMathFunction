# RandMathFunction
It generates random math functions with different level of complexity.

## Future Ideas
- [X] Evaluate the function when x doesn't appear. [Shutting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)
- [X] Values of function in range (-15, +15) with increment of 0.5
- [X] Draw the graph. (In other repo)

## A few bugs
~~arcsin(number>1) and arcsin( (function without x) > 1)~~  
~~arccos(number>1) and arccos( (function without x) > 1)~~

## Compile
cd src
g++ main.cpp -o main  
./main
